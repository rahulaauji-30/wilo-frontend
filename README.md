## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your local development machine. Vite requires Node.js version 14.18+ or 16+.
  - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn**: This project uses npm as the package manager. If you prefer, you can use yarn as well.
  - npm comes with Node.js, so no extra installation is required.
  - [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) (Optional)
